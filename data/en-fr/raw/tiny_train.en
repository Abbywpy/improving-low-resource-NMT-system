Today is a new day!
I want you to get started right away.
Do you see the six windows on the facade?
One should be respectful of other's beliefs rather than mock them.
People usually die if you kill them.
It was working.
Tom needs us to show him the way.
Just do your job.
The train was about to leave the station.
Here is an atomic power plant.
When the alarm clock goes off, I don’t move.
This feels like silk.
A traffic accident happened there.
Tom didn't do that very much.
Tom had just one word to cut so that out of this sentence, forever, disappeared our Mary.
We import coffee from Brazil.
But you cannot understand. How could you understand what it is to feel old?
Why do I believe you?
You spread your affairs too thin.
Those box speakers have a good reverb.
They were hanging on her words.
Instead of complaining, maybe you should help.
I think we can handle that.
I am deeply interested in art.
You are old enough to know this.
I accepted his invitation.
I'd like to hear you sing your new song.
The children are going to the beach today.
Can you believe this is really happening?
He paid the loan with interest.
I know you like chocolate.
I never meant for any of this to happen.
The deer was running by itself.
For him, divorce is a good invention, with one sole disadvantage: you have to get married first.
The bipartisan commission's recommendations were ignored.
I wasn't told where we were going.
That's doubtful.
She intended to become an actress.
He is always expressionless.
He has traveled around the world in eighty days by himself.
Blame it on the weather.
I can explain it to you, but I can't understand it for you!
Shame on you for your discouragement!
He left the room without saying a word.
I'd like to get medical insurance.
He went down the hill.
The girls giggled.
Is anybody there?
I'm not scared of women.
The angry mob overturned cars and smashed storefront windows.
I resign.
I know he is busy.
The man and his horse that fell off the cliff were soon rescued.
She is very cunning.
It was a compromise.
He is apt to forget.
A bird in the hand is better than two in the bush.
If you're busy, I'll help you.
Turn right at the next intersection.
You look busy.
They all laughed at their error.
Tom didn't eat the apple you gave him.
Birds have nests, spiders have webs, and humans have friendship.
Ten years have gone by.
I'm trapped.
Marie reluctantly takes another piece of cake.
I left behind some important documents for the company at home. Sorry, but could you please go and get them for me now?
"Listen to me," said the Demon, placing his hand upon my head.
You should have stopped.
He sprained his ankle.
Tom looks older than he really is.
I was watching the scene holding my breath.
Mary got to know her boyfriend in Paris.
Hand in your papers.
Are you still married?
You must pay in advance.
In Kabylia, we speak the Kabyle language.
She turned a page of her book.
Yes, you should wear red lipstick for Valentine's day.
Tom isn't invited to parties often.
You see the words that I typed on the screen, but you don't see the tears that I shed over the keyboard.
Give me a tip.
What do you want to drink with your meal?
She lives near the beach.
I want to live in a castle.
Don't you see the pattern?
I don't date.
Be respectful.
He can swim fast.
He saw a pretty girl.
The windows were open.
Tom wanted to go home early.
I forgot my debit card at home.
You're trustworthy.
Mary threw a potato through the window.
Everyone deserves a second chance.
I find that it's best to find a happy balance between originality and sticking to a strict standard.
I remember meeting her somewhere.
I'm bringing home a pizza.
Here is where it all happens.
Soon your efforts will be rewarded.
Is the coffee hot?
Thanks for joining us.
It's a pity that you can't travel with us.
I wonder what happened to Paul.
You know where to find me if you need anything.
No one knows his name.
I'm on to you.
It's blowing very hard.
I didn't know you were still here.
We talked about everything we could think about.
I don't have much time.
Don't you feel stupid now?
Tom's phone can take pictures.
What do you want the message to be?
Mom said I caught a cold because I went out with wet hair.
How many more forks do you need?
Rarely have I met such a graceful dancer.
I've missed another chance.
I don't know how to contact you.
Do you want to join me for lunch?
All of these letters are addressed to you.
Tom knew where he had put his keys.
You could count to ten when you were two.
I just found it.
Tom is laughing.
Do you know what day it is today?
The poor cat was run over by a truck.
I don't want to get involved in that business.
There isn't any problem at all.
I was overwhelmed.
The boy was clever enough to solve the puzzle.
I live with a porcupine.
I appreciate your work.
The system is rigged.
An artist must have an eye for colour.
Oh wow! What's this, you're having lunch without me!
You sound tired.
Maybe Tom is in love.
Look at the meter.
Thomas changed into proper clothing.
My mother bought two bottles of orange juice.
Taking everything into consideration, the result is better than I expected.
I guess right nine times out of ten.
That's a nice pair of legs.
It is by this reason that he left school.
"Have you finished?" "On the contrary. I haven't even started."
He doesn't like beef. Neither do I.
Where did you go to school?
Please don't distract me from my work.
By teaching, we learn.
I tell you a little secret.
I'm not scared at all.
He was accompanied by his girlfriend.
His office is near the train station.
Tom was sitting under a tree, drinking wine.
I've been hoping to meet you.
Don't work too hard!
Can you wash my jeans?
Do you speak Maltese?
I'm as curious as you are.
Oh, how we laughed!
What's your occupation?
That picture does not do justice to him.
Don't cut in while we're talking.
It's because I was asked to come that I'm here.
I really wish I could go with you, but I can't.
He is wise who neither hopes nor fears anything from the uncertain future.
Our class has twenty-five boys and twenty girls.
Go away before they see you here.
I'm with them now.
Once I retire, I will dedicate my whole time to Tatoeba.
It's merely a joke.

May I borrow your bike?
What does your father like?
What a catastrophe!
For the sharks, we saw them, not by units, nor by tens, nor by hundreds; but by thousands and by myriads. Trust me, there are more sharks in the sea than mortals on land.
You should get up early.
Love is terrified of everything that is not itself.
He'll be back in ten.
If I wanted to scare you, I would have told you about what I dreamt about a few weeks ago.
You're not dead yet.
I know a good restaurant that's inexpensive.
Who is the person in charge?
Trying to find happiness only makes you unhappy.
I want to speak to a lawyer.
He avenged his dead father.
She liked that.
I'm sore all over.
Why don't you sit down?
Stop showing off!
The weather is very cold in Istanbul.
I'm doing you a favor.
You were afraid, weren't you?
I don't like the taste of onions.
They never returned to their country.
When do you mean to start?
Why do the stars twinkle?
When I came home, he was watching TV.
She named him Charles.
She sang better than him.
I made a proposal.
What do you plan on doing tonight?
I'm afraid you can't do that.
There is milk in the refrigerator.
I don't know her address.
I don't blame you for doing that.
I have a friend who lives in Kyoto.
I think you're too picky.
I opened the window to let in some fresh air.
I could not stop laughing.
Press any key to continue.
I'm not racist.
The fire, driven by an east wind, destroyed the center of the city.
You look terrific.
Sorry to have kept you waiting so long.
Of course I'll go.
This mountain is difficult to climb.
We needed this.
Can you think of a better way?
You've run out of things to drink.
Call me if you want to do something together tomorrow.
At what time are we going to get a bite to eat, with all that?
Who's your most interesting friend?
Be nicer to your brother.

Is this lake deep?
Sea turtles don't have teeth.
How are you taking it?
We live together.

He had a gentleness that was attractive to women.
Charge!
He likes tea.
Whose friend is he?

Did you find the difference between these two photos?
It seems that the rainy season has set in.

He is studying history at the university.
He is such a show off.

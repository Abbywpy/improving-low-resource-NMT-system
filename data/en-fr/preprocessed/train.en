it &apos;s like being in a candy store .
this evening we will go to church .
it &apos;s hot today , isn &apos;t it ?
there were a lot of girls at the party .
come to help me .
I didn &apos;t know Tom was afraid of ghosts .
he is well @-@ liked .
I added his name to the list .
thank you for your efforts .
I need to see you in my office .
the costs are too high .
I would like you to think about what you would have done in my place .
don &apos;t mess with me !
I feel very strongly about that .
she owes me money .
can you leave me alone ?
Tom told me he wasn &apos;t happy here .
this little girl lives in Brazil .
I feel like someone just walked over my grave .
give me chapter and verse .
can you come over and talk ?
I know that Tom might want to learn how to do that .
our garden produced an abundance of cabbages last year .
why don &apos;t we talk in your office ?
Tom didn &apos;t show up for work yesterday .
I must find out who is behind this .
I thought you &apos;d want to meet my family .
I can &apos;t stand this hot weather .
give us the details .
she witnessed him being killed .
I &apos;ll never give up .
I was trapped in a vicious circle .

Sami came to give Layla her gift .
nothing was funny .
I never loved you .
let &apos;s talk man to man .
I can &apos;t do that with you because I don &apos;t have enough money .
Tom is boring , isn &apos;t he ?
I didn &apos;t sleep long enough .
we are living through a biodiversity crisis .
I know something &apos;s wrong .
I just don &apos;t want to go with you .
really ? I didn &apos;t know she was your sister .
he &apos;s working at his English .
they live on the floor beneath .
there is a pond in the middle of the park .
don &apos;t worry . I &apos;ll be right back .

you must not stop on the hard shoulder to go to the toilet .
something is wrong with the engine of this car .
I was surprised by the news this morning .
Tom gets upset easily .
this man is a legend .
enjoy your meal ! did you already start ?
you &apos;re a snob .
I figured I could count on you .
we &apos;d like another bottle of wine .
may I put it down here ?
if Tom has a problem with me , he should tell me .
at what time is dinner served ?
I asked him for advice .
she is always forgetting my phone number .
what has become of him since then ?
she doesn &apos;t study as hard as her sister .
you would like it .
the price is reasonable .
Industries increasingly became geared for outer space .
she likes no one and no one likes her .
just pretend you don &apos;t know me .
the name of my country is written without any article .
the industrialised world is used to using water profligately .
thank you for your detailed explanation .
you &apos;re my hero , Sami .
my legs are weak .
she doesn &apos;t know the title of the book you &apos;re talking about .
let &apos;s talk shop for a while .
she poured the milk into a bowl .
run hot water into the bath .
she treated me badly .
may I have your order , please ?
the radio is a bit loud .
Mary is a yodeler .
he kept on laughing at me .
I could tell you about beekeeping for hours , but I don &apos;t want to bore you .
don &apos;t all speak at once .
it was very cold .
I &apos;m getting tired of looking at furniture we can &apos;t afford .
he wants you to come home .
you &apos;re early .
I found the empty box .
she made him rich .
he was standing at the top of the mountain .
she leaned towards me .
this is what I wanted .
you remind me of myself when I was your age .
these pieces of furniture are not for sale .
I love what you &apos;ve done to this place .
I am learning German .
please close the door behind you .
have you made a list yet ?
without oxygen , all animals would have disappeared long ago .
why &apos;s Tom still here ?
we need money .
it &apos;s my fault , not yours .
no one is amused .

our teacher often overlooked his name on the list .
Tom still owes me a lot of money .
get the hell out my way !
be careful !
the population of Japan is larger than that of New Zealand .
I &apos;d prefer not to eat that .
the price rose .
the pain has lessened a little .
I wish I could explain to you how important this is to me .
any chance you know where I put my keys ?
that &apos;s terrible advice .
I &apos;ve come a long way .
you &apos;re all set ?
that &apos;s absolute nonsense !
the teacher punished her students for using bad words .
how can you accuse me of such a thing ? I would never lay a hand on my child .
Tom is thirsty .
he has a Southern accent .
don &apos;t give them to her .
I was ready today .
the problem is theirs .
in times of crisis one should never idealise the past .
you can &apos;t sit there .
I like to swim in the afternoon .
I left my umbrella in the cab .
I didn &apos;t even know you spoke French .
we get together once a year .
that was Tom &apos;s cousin .
I &apos;m not sure I &apos;d want to live here .

Tom was on TV yesterday .
painting is very easy when you do not know how to do it . when you know , it &apos;s very difficult .
I wanted to talk to you about something .

I wonder if Tom will tell Mary the truth .
I &apos;m sorry to be so late . the meeting completely slipped my mind .
